# CommandPattern
This is command pattern example
Command Pattern is one of the Behavioral Design Pattern. Command design pattern is used to implement loose coupling in a request-response model.
This example contains three roles: Command, Response listener and InvokerCommand. The client just only use the invokerCommand to pass the request to the command
and the command would process the request and response result to the specific response listener.
