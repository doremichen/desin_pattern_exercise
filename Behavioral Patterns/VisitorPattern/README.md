# visitor_pattern: 
Visitor design pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns. It is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.
Define Itarget and Ivisitor first. The ITarget is the interface of componet that need to be visit and the IVisitor is the interface of visitor.ObjectStructure is used to combine the component and visitor.
